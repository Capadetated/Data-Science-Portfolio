# R-Based Projects

Association Mining on Wages
* https://github.com/Capadetated/Association-Mining-Wages
* This R-based project used Association Mining to find patterns within a dataset pertaining to wages.

Logistic Regression Analysis on Heart Disease
* https://github.com/Capadetated/SA-Heart-Logistic-Regression
* This R-based project used Logistic Regression to predict whether a person had heart disease or not.

Decision Tree Analysis on Pima Indian Diabetes
* https://github.com/Capadetated/Decision-Tree-Pima-Diabetes
* This R-based project used Decision Tree analysis to predict whether a Pima individual would likely develop diabetes.

Neural Network Analysis on Phishing Data
* https://github.com/Capadetated/Neural-Network-Phishing
* This R-based project used a Neural Network to predict whether a website was phishing or not. 

K-Means Clustering Analysis on Protein Localization Sites
* https://github.com/Capadetated/K-Means-Protein-Localization
* This R-based project used K-Means Clustering to find patterns in a dataset of protein localization sites.

Textual analysis of Online Hotel Reviews
* https://github.com/Capadetated/Text-Analysis-Hotel-Reviews
* This R-based project used textual analysis of >35,000 hotel reviews to identify key insights for hotels (group project).

# SAS Enterprise Miner-Based Projects

Support Vector Machine Predictive Analysis on Bank Loan Data
* https://github.com/Capadetated/SVM-Modeling-on-Universal-Bank-Dataset/
* This SAS Enterprise Miner-based project used 12 SVM models to predict whether customers would accept a personal loan from their bank.

Ensemble Modeling Predictive Analysis on Bank Loan Data
* https://github.com/Capadetated/Ensemble-Modeling-on-Universal-Bank-Dataset/tree/main
* This SAS Enterprise Miner-based project used 15 SVM and Ensemble models to predict whether customers would accept a personal loan from their bank.

Ensemble Modeling Predictive Analysis on Bank Loan Data (Heterogenous Ensemble Models)
* https://github.com/Capadetated/Ensemble-Modeling-2-on-Universal-Bank-Dataset  
* This SAS Enterprise Miner-based project used 4 weaker models and 12 Heterogenous Ensemble models to predict whether customers would accept a personal loan from their bank.

# Tableau-Based Projects

Video Presentation of TSLA Stock Prediction
* https://github.com/Capadetated/TSLA-Stock-Presentation
* This Tableau-based video presentation urged investors should hold their Tesla stocks based on current trends of early 2021 and correctly predicted that TSLA market capitalization would outperform the modeled $765 billion in Dec 2021.

# SQL-Based Projects

Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) Via SQL Executive Summary
* https://github.com/Capadetated/SQL-ETL-Executive-Summary
* This SQL-based executive summary demonstrates a typical ETL process, shows an ERD, and makes recommendations for best data warehousing approach (group project).

# IBM Cognos Analytics-Based Projects

Exploratory Data Analysis and Dashboarding on Car Fuel Data
* https://github.com/Capadetated/Cars-Dataset-Exploration
* This IBM Cognos-based project used a variety of dashboards to show insights gained, and 2 Decision Trees to predict average MPG and Horsepower (group project).

Exploratory Data Analysis and Dashboarding on Nashville Housing Market Data
* https://github.com/Capadetated/Nashville-Housing-EDA
* This IBM Cognos-based project used 5 types of graphs to give insights to the Nashville Housing market based on the 2013-2016 data.

Predictive Analysis on Used Car Data
* https://github.com/Capadetated/Predicting-Used-Car-Price
* This IBM Cognos-based project used 4 Decision Trees to predict used car prices.

Exploratory Data Analysis and Dashboarding on Used Car Data
* https://github.com/Capadetated/Used-Car-EDA-And-Storytelling
* This IBM Cognos-based project used EDA to gain insights to this dataset. The report also generated 3 decision trees to predict car prices: 1. all vehicles: 81% 2. diesel cars only: 75% 3. petrol cars only (76%).
